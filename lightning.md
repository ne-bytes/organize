# Lightning Talks

It's lightning talk time!

We're looking for short, 5-15 minute talks on technology-related topics.

Do you have...
- Discovered a new language or tool you would like to share
- A technique no one else knows about
- A pearl of wisdom you'd like to share
- A problem you fought hard to solve
- A language or tool you are curious about
- A pet project you've been tinkering with?
- Slides or demo or live coding?

If so, come along and talk.

## First time speaking?

We can work with you to practice your talk ahead of the event if you would like. 

We may event have prizes for the best talks - watch this space.
