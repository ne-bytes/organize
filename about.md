NE Bytes is a user group covering the North East and Cumbria in the UK. We have technical meetings covering Development and IT Pro topics every month.

We meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday.

Each meeting usually consists of two one hour long sessions from speakers from the UK, Europe and beyond. One session will cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic.

In between there is a half an hour break for food, refreshments and time for you to chat with the other attendees.
