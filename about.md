NE Bytes is a user group covering the North East and Cumbria in the UK. We have technical meetings covering software development and IT Pro topics every month.

We usually meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday. This can be open to flexing depending on other events and the schedules of speakers and guests. 

## Virtual Events

Currently we are running all events over Microsoft Teams but expect to return to in person meetups whenever conditions make it safe to do so. Links to the Teams events are posted on our events page.


## In Person Events

Each meeting usually consists of two one hour long sessions from speakers from the UK, Europe and beyond. One session will cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic.

In between there is a half an hour break for food, refreshments and time for you to chat with the other attendees.
