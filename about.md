North East Bytes (NEBytes) is a User Group covering the North East and Cumbrian regions of the United Kingdom.  We 
have technical meetings covering Development and IT Pro topics every month.

Meeting Format

We meet on the third Wednesday of every month except in December where we meet on the second Wednesday. Each meeting 
consists of two excellent one hour long sessions from a stellar line up of speakers from the UK, Europe 
and beyond.  One session will cover a Development topic and the second an IT Pro topic.  In between there is a 
half an hour break for food, refreshments and time for you to chat with the other attendees.  Invariably we 
also follow the meeting with a drink in a local pub.

Meeting Location

Meetings are held at Campus North http://campusnorth.co.uk/. You can find directions here https://goo.gl/maps/gJglS.

Occasionally, meetings are held at Newcastle University.  We are very grateful to the University for providing 
this facility to us.  http://www.ncl.ac.uk/travel/maps/navigator.php?type=&bldg=16&go.x=12&go.y=10

What Does it Cost?

Nothing, Zilch, Nada!  All of our meetings are free to attend, we donâ€™t intend to charge for any of our meetings.  We 
provide our time for organising and arranging our events.  Speakers kindly offer their time for free.

We provide cold refreshments free of charge however we do operate an honesty/donation box whereby if you wish to 
partake in hot food (pizza etc), please put a small donation in the box at the beginning of the meeting to 
help us to cover the costs of the purchase of the food.  Any monies left over from this at the end of the 
year are used to provide giveaways and prizes for the group for the following year.


Who are North East Bytes?

North East Bytes was co-founded by Andrew Westgarth, Jonathan Noble, Damien Foggon and Ben Lee in late 2009.  They wanted 
to create a group which catered for Developers and IT Pros in the region and there key aim was to provide the group for free.
